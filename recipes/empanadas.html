  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>An empanada or pie is a thin bread dough, shortcrust pastry or puff pastry filled with a salty or sweet
  preparation and baked or fried. The filling can include red or white meat, cheese, fish, vegetables or fruit.
  The dough is generally made from wheat flour although corn flour or other cereals can also be used â€“ and
  usually contains some fat, oil or butter .</p>
  <p>Empanadas are a traditional dish in most cuisines of Hispanic countries, such as Spain and Latin America .</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 cupsBread flour corn flour</li>
    <li>1/4cup of Wheat Flour</li>
    <li>2.5 cupswater</li>
    <li>1 tspsalt</li>
    <li>2 tspsugar</li>
    <li>Oil for stretching the dough and for frying</li>
    <li>Stuffing to taste (these are the shredded chicken in my recipes)</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Preparation</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>The water first in a bowl with the salt and sugar, little by little I add the corn flour, knead and then add the wheat flour, knead and let it rest while I assemble the work area.</li>
    <li>On a flat surface (I used a cutting board) we spread a plastic sheet (I cut a bag), which must be emulsified with fingers dipped in oil (I placed it in one of the small pots)</li>
    <li>I make a small ball with the dough (fist size), I wet my fingers in water (the other small bowl) and flatten it in a round (the thinner the better, but be careful not to break it under the weight of the filling).</li>
    <li>I put the filling in the center (so that there is no liquid, otherwise the dough will break... a trick is to have the stew in the refrigerator so that the liquid is firm) I close the edges and flatten it to finally form a half-moon shape with a round container</li>
    <li>I remove and recycle the excess edge, and slowly peel off the plastic to pour into the hot oil. Let it brown on both sides and enjoy!</li>
    <li>The classic flavors of the fillings are: cheese, ground beef, shredded beef, chicken, fish. Combined like cheese and meat, cheese and black beans. And anything you can think of can serve as a filling for these wonders... there are those who make them baked but I don't know the technique, there are those who make beet, banana, etc. dough... you can accompany it with garlic sauce, tartar or any mojito or spicy. Enjoy!</li>
