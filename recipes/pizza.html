  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Margherita pizza ( in Italian pizza Margherita ) is a typical Neapolitan pizza made with tomato , mozzarella ( Fior di latte is traditionally used ), fresh basil , salt and oil . This is the most popular Neapolitan pizza, along with the marinera.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Water 120cc</li>
    <li>Fresh Basil 5g</li>
    <li>Flour 200 grs.</li>
    <li>Garlic 2 Teeth</li>
    <li>Salt 5g</li>
    <li>Yeast 5gr</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Preparation</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>If we have chosen to prepare a homemade pizza dough , on the blog you can find the recipe for how we make it at home. It is a very tasty and tender dough that I encourage you to prepare.</li>
    <li>Once we have the pizza dough prepared, the first thing we do is turn on the oven. Full, the maximum of your oven. In my case at 250ยบ C for about 10 minutes and that it is hot when you insert the pizza.</li>
    <li>As the temperature must be high, it may take 10 or 15 minutes. It will be the recommended time we need to assemble the pizza.</li>
    <li>We put a bowl (safe for oven) with water, so that it has some moisture when we are going to bake it. Once we have the pizza dough prepared, already spread on baking paper, we prepare the filling.</li>
  </ol>
